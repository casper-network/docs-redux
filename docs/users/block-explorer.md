# Block Explorers

The Casper blockchain is available in Mainnet and Testnet. The Mainnet is the live network where real CSPR tokens are used. The Testnet, on the other hand, is a separate environment for experimentation and testing, allowing developers to try out applications and features without spending real tokens.

Block explorers are web-based tools that make blockchain data accessible and searchable. They can be used to explore activity on both the Testnet and the Mainnet.

One of the most popular explorers for the Casper Network is [CSPR.live](https://cspr.live)

## What is a Block Explorer?

A block explorer is a search engine for the blockchain. It allows users to track transactions, monitor validator performance, view account activity, and explore blocks and node operations. Essentially, block explorers provide a transparent window into everything happening on the blockchain.

Since the introduction of Zug Consensus in Casper 2.0, validator performance is tracked on a per-block basis. Rewards are now calculated based solely on each validator’s individual participation, therefore block explorers are even more useful for users who want to monitor staking rewards and validator reliability with greater precision.

## Using a Block Explorer

Block explorers allow you to:

* Track token transfers and account balances
* View live data on blocks, transactions, and validator activity
* Monitor staking rewards and undelegation schedules
* Verify smart contract deployments
* Explore Testnet behavior before Mainnet features go live

You can transfer tokens, manage your stake, delegate, and undelegate to validators directly through explorers.

To do so, you’ll need to sign in with a supported wallet (e.g. [Casper Wallet](https://www.casperwallet.io), Ledger, or other integrations).
